## About _Q2DTor_

    Name of the Program: Q2DTor  
    Program Version : 2020.1
    Program Version Date: February 28, 2020  
    Manual  Version Date: February 28, 2020

_Q2DTor_ is a program designed to calculate partition functions and thermodynamic 
properties of molecular systems with two or more torsional modes. 
It allows calculating rotational-vibrational (or rovibrational) 
partition functions and thermodynamic functions by the multistructural harmonic 
oscillator (MS-HO) and the Extended Two-Dimensional Torsion (E2DT) methods. 
If the molecule has more than two torsions, the program treats only two of them as 
torsions, with the others harmonic. 
_Q2DTor_ has to be executed in several steps, each one of them performing a different task. 
With this 'step-by-step' procedure the user can check the output file after a 
given task (and before proceeding to the next one).


## Version information

### Version 2020.1

List of known bugs and changes/additions in version 2020.1:
  - _Q2DTor_ is now part of a bigger project, __The Cathedral Package__.
  - _Q2DTor_ has been ported to __Python 3__.
  - Now the version name is based on the release year;
  - The path to the electronic structure software is now obtained from
    the environment variables instead of from the _mesc.txt_ file.

### Version 1.1

List of known bugs and changes/additions in version 1.1:
- Important:
  - Corrected a bug in the function that reads the xyz file (problem with empty lines).
  - Corrected a bug related to the calculation of partition functions
    in systems with the 'a' symmetry condition.
  - Corrected a bug in the calculation of S and G for MSHO.
  - License was changed from GPL-3.0 to MIT/X11.
- Minor:
  - The version of _Q2DTor_ is printed after the logo of the program.
  - The date is added at the beginning of each execution.
  - The q2dtor.py executable and its modules are now separated.
    Modules are stored in the `mq2dtor/` folder.
  - If tsigma1 * tsigma2 is not equal to 1, it is assumed that the system meets the
    'c'  type condition of symmetry even if that it is not specified in the input file.
  - For systems with 'b' type symmetry, odd symmetry terms of the Fourier series are
    automatically removed, even if they are specified by the user in the input file.
  - If tsigma_i is not 1, the corresponding Fourier terms of the phi_i dihedral
    are multiplies of tsigma_i. Other terms are automatically removed even if they are
    specified in the input file.
  - Now, by default, the scan of the PES starts at the closest point to the input
    geometry instead of at (phi1,phi2)=(0,0).
  - Option --SI is now available, which prints the energies in kJ/mol.
  - A new table for each thermodynamic function is added.

## Description of files

 Contents of the folders distributed in this version:
  - **src/**       : _Q2DTor_ source files
  - **manual/**    : Manual of _Q2DTor_
  - **tests/**     : All the files related to the tests set

The _Q2DTor_ source folder consists of:

   - **q2dtor.py**:
     This is the main file of _Q2DTor_, i.e., the one to be executed

   - Directory **modq2dtor/**, which contains the following files: 
     - **constants.py**:
        It contains different physical constants as well as atomic masses and covalent radii.
     - **classes.py**:
       It contains different Python classes that are used along the whole code. 
       For example, it contains different classes related to graph theory. 
       These allow to obtain the connectivity of a given geometry or a set of
       internal coordinates in just a few calls.
     - **gtsfile.py**:
       It contains functions that read and write a gts file (the format used by Q2Dtor). 
       These gts files contain information about stationary points: geometry, gradient, 
       Hessian matrix, etc.
     - **helpfns.py**:
       It contains different auxiliary functions (for example for example the function
       that converts Cartesian coordinates to mass-scaled Cartesian).
     - **mesc_gaussian.py**:
       It contains the interface to the Gaussian Package.  
     - **mesc_orca.py**:
       It contains the interface to the Orca Package.
     - **tesselation.py**:
       It contains functions related to the tesselation of the 2D potential energy surface.
     - **quotes.py**:
       It contains some quotes to print when the program ends.

The tests folder contains the output files of the tests set and an script to run them. 


## Installation

Q2Dtor is a program written in Python 3. Consequently, it does not need any kind 
of compilation, as it would be the case with C or Fortran programs.
The user should install Python 3 in order to use _Q2DTor_, 
as well as the following Python libraries:
   - matplotlib
   - numpy
   - pylab
   - scipy

WARNING: __do not__ use Python 2 to execute _Q2DTor_.


## Setting up the program

In order to interact with Gaussian and/or Orca, _Q2DTor_ needs to know the location of some executable files.
Such information is obtained from the following environment variables, which have to be defined and exported by the user in their __.bashrc__ file:

   - Environment variables for Gaussian software:

      - GauExe : with the path to the Gaussian executable

      - GauFchk : with the path to the formchk tool

   -  Environment variable for Orca software:

      - OrcaExe : with the path to the Orca executable

For example:

``` export GauExe="/home/programs/g09/g09 " ```

``` export GauFchk="/home/programs/g09/formchk " ```

``` export OrcaExe="/home/programs/orca_4_0_1_2/orca " ```


## Execution

You can run _Q2DTor_ by invoking the Python interpreter manually as follows:

   ```python3.6 q2dtor.py```

If you prefer to avoid invoking the Python interpreter, you have to follow these
two simple steps:

1. Add as first line in the q2dtor.py the following:

   ```#!PATH_FOR_PYTHON python```

   where PATH_FOR_PYTHON indicates the location of the Python interpreter.

   Example:

   ```#!/usr/bin/env python3.6```

   In this example Python is located in /usr/bin/env. 

2. Make the main program q2dtor.py executable:

   ```chmod u+x q2dtor.py```

   This allows you to run _Q2DTor_ just using:

   ```q2dtor.py```

Before run _Q2DTor_, we recommend to read the help menu.
It can be displayed either by typing

   ```q2dtor.py --help```

or 

   ```q2dtor.py -h```

## Running the tests set

In the tests directory there is a script called `Q2DTorTesting.py`
that facilitates running the tests set. 
                                                            
The script runs under Python version 2.x. It is executed by typing:

  ```python Q2DTorTesting.py```

This action opens the next interactive menu:                  

     |  << Test creator for Q2DTor >>
     | 
     |     Select case:
     |      (1) HF/sto-3g (GAUSSIAN)
     |      (2) HF/sto-3g (ORCA)
     | 
     |     your choice: 

where you should choose case (1) to run the tests with Gaussian and case (2)
to run them with for Orca. Once selected, the menu displays:

     |    Select action:
     |     (1) Create input files
     |     (2) Check number of Stationary Points
     |     (3) Check results against refdata file
     |     ..  to exit

Selecting action (1), the corresponding folder (GAUSSIAN/ or ORCA/)
containing the 20 test folders (one per system) will be created. 
                                                            
For each system, you can find the xyz file with the reference
geometry and the corresponding _Q2DTor_ input file. 
                                                            
After executing q2dtor.py for a given system (or for all of
them), you can check your results by using the actions (2) and (3)
the `Q2DTorTesting.py` script.

### Carrying out S10 and S19 test systems

The searching algorithm for systems _S10_ and _S19_ is not able to find one
transition state (we recommned to generate the pdf file
after executing _Q2DTor_ with the --findsp option to visualize this).
In these cases, the user should add the following line
at the end of the `SXX/IOfiles/SXX.splist` file (XX=10,19):

  - In 'S10/IOfiles/S10.splist':

    ```1 170.00 60.00 - NO S10_170_060```

  - For 'S19/IOfiles/S19.splist'

    ```1 130.00 70.00 - NO S19_130_070```

Check the manual for more information about the search
and optimization procedures of the stationary points.
